Exceptions:

1. Try (block) -->     will execute a sensitive code which can throw exceptions

2. Catch (block) -->   will be used whenever an exception (of the type caught) is thrown in the try block

3. Finally (block) --> is called in every case after the try/catch blocks. Even if the exception isn't caught 
			   		   or if your previous blocks break the execution flow.
			   
4. Throw (keyword) --> will allow you to throw an exception (which will break the execution flow and can be 
					   caught in a catch block).
					   
5. Throws (keyword) -->  *in the method prototype* is used to specify that your method might throw exceptions
						 of the specified type. It's useful when you have checked exception (exception that you 
						 have to handle) that you don't want to catch in your current method.
